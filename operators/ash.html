She is equipped with a low armor rating but has a high mobility in return. Ash's unique ability is being able to wield and shoot the M120 CREM with 2 breaching rounds which will burrow into a surface and detonate automatically.</p>
                <h3>Biography</h3>
                <p>Born and raised in Jerusalem, Israel, Cohen enrolled at Tel Aviv University after secondary school in the Engineering program. It was during this time she did a semester abroad in Boston University. After college, she enlisted in the Israeli Defense Forces. Her engineering background made her a great candidate for mechanical maintenance and demolitions.

				She was later transferred to FBI SWAT due to an international law enforcement exchange program. Cohen brought her knowledge of demolitions with her in producing a weapon-mounted breach charge capable of blowing open a door or wall from a distance.</p>
               	<h3>Psychological Profile</h3>
               	<p>Her military training as a demolitions specialist has left Cohen with an inflated sense of self. She can be aggressive, impulsive, and overly confident. She is quick to action, which can be an asset or fatal for someone in her line of work.</p><br>
