					<h3>Verse 1</h3>
					<p>Ripped jacket with the stains on the surface</p>
					<p>He was the kid that everyone was happy they weren't</p>
					<p>Sitting alone invisible to every passing person</p>
					<p>Wondering what it would feel like to have a purpose</p>
					<p>He never had a childhood Forced to parent his own parents like no child should</p>
					<p>His father is a veteran drowning his memories with liquor</p>
					<p>And his mother's taking pills that doctors give her but they only make her sicker</p>
					<p>With no sibling to walk through this stuff</p>
					<p>No ends, no money, no friends, no buddies, he ain't talking enough</p>
					<p>He don't put himself out there, he's awkward too much</p>
					<p>Well, who in his life would he learn confidence from?</p>
					<p>And he sits behind me in class</p>
					<p>One day I heard crying from the back</p>
					<p>Finally I turned around and I asked</p>
					<p>What was wrong</p>
					<p>And the first time I heard his voice</p>
					<p>He said "all I know is pain, if this is life, what's the point?</p>
					<p>Show me what happiness is...</p>
					<h3>Hook 1</h3>
					<p>His voice gloomy he looked through me he said</p>
					<p>Show me where happinesses is</p>
					<p>Desperateness on his face</p>
					<p>I didn't know what to say</p>
					<p>I couldn't think</p>
					<p>Show me where happinesses is</p>
					<p>He put his head down</p>
					<p>And he didn't make a sound</p>
					<p>Show me where happinesses is</p>
					<p>And I just froze</p>
					<p>Like I don't even know...</p>
					<h3>Verse 2</h3>
					<p>Perfect makeup even though she don't need the extra touch</p>
					<p>She was the girl that every other girl was jealous of</p>
					<p>Silky hair, blue eyes, thin body with</p>
					<p>Curves, but her new clothes only cover parts of it</p>
					<p>She's almost looked at like a goddess to all</p>
					<p>Attracts every pair of eyes when she walks through the hall</p>
					<p>But she's likable too, she's not the one to gossip</p>
					<p>Evident when you talk to her, she ain't ever pompous</p>
					<p>Wealthy home filled with knowledge and newness</p>
					<p>She was the youngest out of 3 book smart students</p>
					<p>And her parents were so proud, pride was all around her</p>
					<p>But I always noticed something was a little off about her</p>
					<p>She sits in front of me in class</p>
					<p>One day I noticed heavy make up on her wrist when she passed papers back</p>
					<p>After class, I approached her and I asked about it</p>
					<p>She said it don't mean I have it if I'm around it</p>
					<p>Show me where happiness is...</p>
					<h3>Hook 2</h3>
					<p>I looked into her eyes</p>
					<p>I saw her for the first time</p>
					<p>Show me where happiness is</p>
					<p>I saw regret</p>
					<p>She walked away in a sec</p>
					<p>Her voice rang through my head</p>
					<p>Show me where happiness is</p>
					<p>I watched her walk away</p>
					<p>She became another face</p>
					<p>What she say?</p>
					<p>Show me where happiness is</p>
					<p>And I just froze</p>
					<p>Like I don't even know</p>
					<h3>Verse 3</h3>
					<p>I don't know because I ask myself the same thing every single day</p>
					<p>But every single answer has been vague</p>
				   	<p>How come some appreciate the sun after the rain</p>
					<p>While others just see the puddles as if nothing has changed?</p>
					<p>And as I watch people living the life I couldn't take, I wonder if they see a way out to mentally</p>
					<p>And as I watch people who live the life I idolize, I wonder what they feel and what isn't seen</p>
					<p>As I watch my whole family take pills for depression I wonder what true happiness really means</p>
					<p>I wonder if because I'm genetically predisposed to it, that is the reason I find myself feeling weak</p>
					<p>Only sometimes, in and out</p>
					<p>I guess it's scarier when you don't have a reason to be feeling down</p>
					<p>Sometimes I just am</p>
					<p>Sometimes I just feel no one will ever understand</p>
					<p>Sometimes I wanna cry</p>
					<p>Sometimes I want to crush my family's so-called medication look in their eyes</p>
					<p>And tell them they don't need it as long we just have each other</p>
					<p>But then sometimes I watch them suffer</p>
					<p>I just wonder where happiness is</p>
					<h3>Outro</h3>
					<p>Show me where happiness is</p>
